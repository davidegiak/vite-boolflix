# BOOLFLIX

## Description
I create a Netflix type layout in Vue 3 + Vite, using axios calls to take data from "The Movie DB". You can search for movies into the searchbar, and you can also filter to have only movies, only series or movies and series filtered by category.







# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup
